"""Player model tying a role to a decision strategy.

The original implementation exposed only thin wrappers around the strategy
object.  For more complex simulations the :class:`~mafia.game.Game` engine now
interacts with players through a small behavioural interface.  This keeps role
specific logic close to the role itself and allows the engine to remain agnostic
of individual roles.
